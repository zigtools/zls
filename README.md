Zig Language Server, or `zls`, is a language server for Zig. The Zig wiki states that "The Zig community is decentralized" and "There is no concept of 'official' or 'unofficial'", so instead of calling `zls` unofficial, and I'm going to call it a cool option, one of [many](https://github.com/search?q=zig+language+server).

## Installation

Installation starts with downloading an official release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/releases).
Up to date builds from master branch are also available in the [latest successful CI run](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/actions), contained in the `builds` artifact.

See [Downloading and Building ZLS](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/wiki/Downloading-and-Building-ZLS) on the Wiki, or the page about [using ZLS with Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/wiki/Installing-for-Visual-Studio-Code) for a guide to help get `zls` running in your editor.

### Installing binaries

#### MacOS

You can install the latest release into `$HOME/zls` using e.g.:

```sh
brew install xz
mkdir $HOME/zls && cd $HOME/zls && curl -L https://github.com/zigtools/zls/releases/download/0.9.0/x86_64-macos.tar.xz | tar -xJ --strip-components=1 -C .
```

#### Linux

You can install the latest release into `$HOME/zls` using e.g.:

```bash
sudo apt install xz-utils
mkdir $HOME/zls && cd $HOME/zls && curl -L https://github.com/zigtools/zls/releases/download/0.9.0/x86_64-linux.tar.xz | tar -xJ --strip-components=1 -C .
```

### From Source

Building `zls` is very easy. You will need [a build of Zig master](https://ziglang.org/download/) to build zls.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/zigtools/zls
cd zls
zig build -Drelease-safe
./zig-out/bin/zls config # Configure ZLS
```

*For detailed building instructions, see the Wiki page about [Cloning With Git](https://github.com/zigtools/zls/wiki/Downloading-and-Building-ZLS#cloning-with-git).*

#### Build Options

<!-- When updating this table, be sure to copy changes to the Wiki page about building from source. -->
<!-- If this table grows too large, then delete this one and move it all over to the Wiki page about building from source. -->
| Option | Type | Default Value | What it Does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `-Ddata_version` | `string` (like 0.7.1 or 0.9.0) | master | The data file version. This selects the files in the `src/data` folder that correspond to the Zig version being served.|

#### Updating Data Files

There is a `generate-data.py` in the `src/data` folder, run this file to update data files.
It writes to stdout and you can redirect output to a zig file like `master.zig`. By default it generates data file for `master`, but can be configured to generate for a different version by modifying the `zig_version` variable. Files generated by this tool **contains** formatting information.

There is also a `generate-data.js` in the `src/data` folder, you'll need to run this inside a Chrome DevTools console and copy the output. Files generated by this tool **does not contain** formatting information.

### Configuration Options

You can configure zls by running `zls config` or manually creating your own `zls.json` configuration file.
zls will look for a zls.json configuration file in multiple locations with the following priority:
- In the local configuration folder of your OS (as provided by [known-folders](https://github.com/ziglibs/known-folders/blob/master/RESOURCES.md#folder-list))
- In the global configuration folder of your OS (as provided by [known-folders](https://github.com/ziglibs/known-folders/blob/master/RESOURCES.md#folder-list))

The following options are currently available.

| Option | Type | Default value | What it Does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enable_snippets` | `bool` | `false` | Enables snippet completions when the client also supports them. |
| `enable_unused_variable_warnings` | `bool` | `false`| Enables warnings for local variables that aren't used. |
| `enable_import_embedfile_argument_completions` | `bool` | `false` | Whether to enable import/embedFile argument completions |
| `zig_lib_path` | `?[]const u8` | `null` | zig library path, e.g. `/path/to/zig/lib/zig`, used to analyze std library imports. |
| `zig_exe_path` | `?[]const u8` | `null` | zig executable path, e.g. `/path/to/zig/zig`, used to run the custom build runner. If `null`, zig is looked up in `PATH`. Will be used to infer the zig standard library path if none is provided. |
| `warn_style` | `bool` | `false` | Enables warnings for style *guideline* mismatches |
| `build_runner_path` | `?[]const u8` | `null` | Path to the build_runner.zig file provided by zls. `null` is equivalent to `${executable_directory}/build_runner.zig` |
| `build_runner_cache_path` | `?[]const u8` | `null` | Path to a directroy that will be used as zig's cache when running `zig run build_runner.zig ...`. `null` is equivalent to `${KnownFloders.Cache}/zls` |
| `enable_semantic_tokens` | `bool` | `true` | Enables semantic token support when the client also supports it. |
| `operator_completions` | `bool` | `true` | Enables `*` and `?` operators in completion lists. |
|`include_at_in_builtins`|`bool`|`false`| Whether the @ sign should be part of the completion of builtins.
|`max_detail_length`|`usize`|`1024 * 1024`| The detail field of completions is truncated to be no longer than this (in bytes).
| `skip_std_references` | `bool` | `false` | When true, skips searching for references in std. Improves lookup speed for functions in user's code. Renaming and go-to-definition will continue to work as is.

## Features

`zls` supports most language features, including simple type function support, using namespace, payload capture type resolution, custom packages and others.
Notable language features that are not currently implemented include `@cImport` as well as most forms of compile time evaluation.

The following LSP features are supported:
- Completions
- Hover
- Goto definition/declaration
- Document symbols
- Find references
- Rename symbol
- Formatting using `zig fmt`
- Semantic token highlighting (LSP 3.16 proposed feature, implemented by a few clients including VSCode, kak and emacs lsp-mode)

You can install `zls` using the instuctions for your text editor below:

### VSCode

Install the `zls-vscode` extension from [here](https://github.com/zigtools/zls-vscode/releases) and provide a path to the build `zls` executable.

### Sublime Text

    "clients": {
        "zig": {
            "command": ["zls"],
            "enabled": true,
            "languageId": "zig",
            "scopes": ["source.zig"],
            "syntaxes": ["Packages/Zig Language/Syntaxes/Zig.tmLanguage"]
        }
    }
}
```

#### Sublime Text 4

```json

            "command": ["zls"],
            "enabled": true,
            "selector": "source.zig"
        }
    }
}
```

### Kate

- Install language support for Zig from [here](https://github.com/ziglang/kde-syntax-highlighting)
- Enable `LSP client` plugin in Kate settings.
- Add this snippet to `LSP client's` user settings (e.g. /$HOME/.config/kate/lspclient)
  (or paste it in `LSP client's` GUI settings)

```json
{
    "servers": {

            "command": ["zls"],
            "url": "https://github.com/zigtools/zls",
            "highlightingModeRegex": "^Zig$"
        }
    }
}
```

### Neovim/Vim8
#### CoC

- Install the CoC engine from [here](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim).

Then choose one of the following two ways

1. Use extension

    Run `:CocInstall coc-zls` to install [coc-zls](https://github.com/xiyaowong/coc-zls), 
    this extension supports the same functionality as the VScode extension
  
2. Manually register
    ```json
    {
       "languageserver": {
           "zls" : {
               "command": "command_or_path_to_zls",
               "filetypes": ["zig"]
           }
       }
    }
    ```

#### YouCompleteMe
- Install YouCompleteMeFrom [here](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe.git).
- Add these lines to your vimrc:

```vim
"ensure zig is a recognized filetype
autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *.zig set filetype=zig

let g:ycm_language_server =
  \ [
  \{
  \     'name': 'zls',
  \     'filetypes': [ 'zig' ],
  \     'cmdline': [ '/path/to/zls_executable' ]
  \    }
  \ ]
```

#### nvim-lspconfig

Requires Nvim 0.5 (HEAD)!

- Install nvim-lspconfig from [here](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig).
- Install zig.vim from [here](https://github.com/ziglang/zig.vim).

nvim-lspconfig already ships a configuration for zls. A simple `init.vim` might look like this:
```vim
call plug#begin('~/.config/nvim/plugged')
Plug 'neovim/nvim-lspconfig'
Plug 'nvim-lua/completion-nvim'
Plug 'ziglang/zig.vim'
call plug#end()

:lua << EOF
    local lspconfig = require('lspconfig')

    local on_attach = function(_, bufnr)
        vim.api.nvim_buf_set_option(bufnr, 'omnifunc', 'v:lua.vim.lsp.omnifunc')
        require('completion').on_attach()
    end

    local servers = {'zls'}
    for _, lsp in ipairs(servers) do
        lspconfig[lsp].setup {
            on_attach = on_attach,
        }
    end
EOF

" Set completeopt to have a better completion experience
set completeopt=menuone,noinsert,noselect

" Enable completions as you type
let g:completion_enable_auto_popup = 1
```

#### LanguageClient-neovim

- Install the LanguageClient-neovim from [here](https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim)
- Edit your neovim configuration and add `zls` for zig filetypes:

```vim
let g:LanguageClient_serverCommands = {
       \ 'zig': ['~/code/zls/zig-out/bin/zls'],
       \ }
```

### Emacs

- Install [lsp-mode](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode) from melpa
- [zig mode](https://github.com/ziglang/zig-mode) is also useful

```elisp
;; Setup lsp-mode as desired.
;; See https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/page/installation/ for more information.
(require 'lsp-mode)

;; Either place zls in your PATH or add the following:
(setq lsp-zig-zls-executable "<path to zls>")
```

### Doom Emacs

- Enable the `lsp` module
- Install the [zig-mode](https://github.com/ziglang/zig-mode) package (add `(package! zig-mode)` to your `packages.el` file
- Add the following to your `config.el`:

```elisp
(use-package! zig-mode
  :hook ((zig-mode . lsp-deferred))
  :custom (zig-format-on-save nil)
  :config
  (after! lsp-mode
    (add-to-list 'lsp-language-id-configuration '(zig-mode . "zig"))
    (lsp-register-client
      (make-lsp-client
        :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection "<path to zls>")
        :major-modes '(zig-mode)
        :server-id 'zls))))
```

### Spacemacs

- Add `lsp` and `zig` to `dotspacemacs-configuration-layers` in your `.spacemacs` file.
- If you don't have `zls` in your `PATH`, add the following to `dotspacemacs/user-config` in your
  `.spacemacs` file:

```elisp
(setq lsp-zig-zls-executable "<path to zls>")
```
